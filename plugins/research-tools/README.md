# research-tools

> Deep research, learning, and technical writing

## What's Included

### Agents (3)
- **tech-stack-researcher** - Research and compare technologies, frameworks, and tools
- **learning-guide** - Teach programming concepts with progressive learning and practical examples
- **technical-writer** - Create clear, comprehensive technical documentation

### Skills (1)
- **humanizer** - Detect and refine AI writing patterns for more natural output

## When to Use

**Install this if you**:
- Learn new technologies frequently
- Write technical documentation
- Research solution approaches before implementing
- Need to compare frameworks/tools

**Don't install if you**:
- Rarely learn new tech
- Don't write documentation

## Use Cases

### 1. Technology Research
```
User: "Research the best state management for React in 2026"
tech-stack-researcher: Compares Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc.
Output: Comparison matrix with recommendations
```

### 2. Learning New Concepts
```
User: "Explain Rust ownership and borrowing"
learning-guide: Progressive explanation with examples
Output: Tutorial with runnable code samples
```

### 3. Documentation Writing
```
User: "Write API documentation for this endpoint"
technical-writer: Creates clear, comprehensive docs
Output: Markdown documentation with examples
```

### 4. Humanize AI Writing
```
/humanizer Review this README and make it less AI-sounding
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Research technology
Ask: "What's the best database for time-series data?"

# Learn a concept
Ask: "Teach me how async/await works in Python"

# Deep research
Ask: "Research authentication strategies for multi-tenant SaaS"

# Write documentation
Ask: "Document this API with examples and error codes"

# Detect AI patterns
/humanizer Check this blog post for AI writing patterns
```

## Workflow Example

**Problem**: Need to choose a framework for a new project

**Step 1**: Research
```
tech-stack-researcher: "Compare Next.js, Remix, and SvelteKit for SSR"
Output: Comparison of features, performance, ecosystem
```

**Step 2**: Learn
```
learning-guide: "Explain server components in Next.js 14"
Output: Tutorial with examples
```

**Step 3**: Document
```
technical-writer: "Create setup guide for Next.js with our stack"
Output: Step-by-step documentation
```

## Recommended Combinations

**Learning new tech**:
- research-tools ✅
- scott-cc ✅ (main plugin for implementations)

**Solo developer**:
- research-tools ✅ (learn and document)
- mutation-testing ✅ (ensure quality)
